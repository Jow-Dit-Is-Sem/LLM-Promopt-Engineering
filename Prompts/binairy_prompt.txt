Let's count how many instances of 'e' the word 'deified' contains. The solution is obtained by tansforming the word in a binairy list. Consider the word as a list of binairy numers: 0 or 1. An instance of 0 in the list would correspond to a letter in the word that is not equal to the stated letter, an instance of 1 in the list would correspond to a letter in the word that is equal to the stated letter. For the word 'deified' and the stated letter 'e', this would result in: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Then the instances of the number 1 are summed up to obtain the solution: 1 + 1 = 2. This means that the word 'deified' contains two instances of the letter 'e'. This considered, how many instances of '{}' does the word '{}' contain considering the binairy list: {}?
